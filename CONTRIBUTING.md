# Working on an existing issue

- Make sure that the issue is labeled Help Wanted before starting to work on it.
- Add a comment in the issue that you are starting to work on it.
- Ask for any information that you feel is missing from the issue for you to be able to work on it.
- Clone the repo or fork the repo. Check out a new branch based on master, naming it ISSUE_NUM/some-description, 
e.g. for issue number 2 a branch name can be  2/adds-volume-chart
- Please add tests to your work. An easy way to do this is by generating new Angular pieces using the Angular CLI.
Before doing a PR, run `ng test` to make sure all tests are passing.
- Create a new PR (Pull Request) from your cloned repo and reference the issue number in it.
- Submit your PR when you believe your code is ready for code review.
- Follow up on code review comments by one of the project maintainers on your Pull Request (PR)
